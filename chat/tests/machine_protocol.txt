Machine Protocol
================

The machine protocol is not meant for direct human communication, it is 
instead a protocol for communication amoungst machines.

JSON serialization being common place in many languages was chosen to 
convey the protocol.

Lets start by defining a switch action which could be used to turn on a light.

    >>> switch_action = {'class' : 'switch.action',
    ...                  'action' : 'on',
    ...                  'expiry' : 10,
    ...                  'control' : 0 }


A device can register to be notified of certain events.

    >>> register = {'class' : 'notification.register',
    ...             'event' : 'on',
    ...             'control' : 0 }


A device can unregister from notifications for an event.

    >>> register = {'class' : 'notification.unregister',
    ...             'event' : 'on',
    ...             'control' : 0 }


To find out what controls the endpoint contains we can ask it to describe
it self.

    >>> describe = {'class' : 'describe.query',
    ...             'control_types' : ['switch', level]}

The endpoint would respond to a describe query.

    >>> describe = {'class' : 'describe.response',
    ...             'controls' : [
    ...                 {'id' : 0,
    ...                  'name' : 'Front light',
    ...                  'class' : 'switch',
    ...                  'status' : 'on'},]}
